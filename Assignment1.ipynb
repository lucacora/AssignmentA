    "In Part A, you will apply the concepts you have learned in Chapter 6: Descriptive Statistics.\n",
    "Provide a comprehensive description of the data by applying different concepts of Chapter 6 on the data,\n",

    "TIPS:\n",
    "• Make sure you use a variety of concepts from Chapter 6.\n",

    "• For each plot and summary statistic, include a written interpretation. What does the plot or\n",
